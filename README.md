# DNA-Encryption Steganography

A simple plain text is converted into DNA by conversion of each of characters into nucleiods to pairing into Amino Acids. These acids in binary form are then embedded in an image using 2-3-3 LSB where the last 2 bits of the RED plane and the last 3 bits of each of the GREEN & BLUE plane are substituted with bits of cipher text for each pixel
